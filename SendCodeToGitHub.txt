Stage all changes for commit with git add -A. This tells git to start 
tracking the files, but doesn't yet treat them as an official part of 
the local repository history.
Verify that all of your desired changes have been staged for committing 
with git status. We should see the README.md file listed under "Changes 
to be committed".
Commit the changes, recording README.md as an official part of history 
with git commit -m "Add README.md". You can change the message to 
anything you like.
Push the updated, official history to the GitHub remote repository with 
git push origin master.
